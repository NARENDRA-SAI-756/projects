# Kubernetes Project

1. In this project I have created the kubernetes manifest files for our microservices and deployed them in the AWS EKS cluster.

2. These are just file format and does not include any confidential information. For security reasons I have hided the information like URLs, passwords etc.

3. These files are for our Development environment and I have created similar yaml files for Stage and Production environment and deployed them in respective EKS clusters.
